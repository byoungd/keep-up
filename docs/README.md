# Keep-Up Documentation Index

Welcome to the **Keep-Up** engineering documentation. This index serves as the map for the project's technical specifications, architectural vision, and research history.

## 🌟 Authoritative Source of Truth

***Stop here if you are implementing Agent Runtime features.***

*   **`docs/specs/`**: The formal technical specifications. Code MUST conform to these documents.
    *   [**Agent Runtime Spec v2026.1**](specs/agent-runtime-spec-2026.md) - **Tier 1 Critical**. The definitive contract for the agent loop, recovery, state persistence, and role SOPs.
