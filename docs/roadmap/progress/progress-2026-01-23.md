## Summary
- **LFCC v0.9.4 Rust Accelerators** delivered: comprehensive suite of Rust packages (`anchor-relocation-rs`, `ai-sanitizer-rs`, etc.) implemented and integrated.
- **Markdown Operations** hardened: semantic block ops, frontmatter key targeting, and exhaustive type safety merged into Core.
- **Cowork UI** enhanced: Checkpoints/Recovery tab added to Context Panel (Session Context).
- **Agent Runtime** modularization continues: core/control/telemetry/vision packages stable; execution/persistence extraction in progress.

## Evidence from Recent Merges
- **PR #232**: `feat: add markdown semantic block ops`
- **PR #231**: `fix: align markdown frontmatter updates`
- **PR #230**: `feat(core): add md_update_frontmatter operation`
- **PR #229**: `feat(cowork): add checkpoints tab in session context panel`
- **PR #228**: `feat: implement frontmatter key targeting`

## Next Steps
- **L1/L2 Execution/Persistence Extraction**: Continue extraction of `agent-runtime-execution` and `agent-runtime-persistence` from monolith.
- **Cowork Polish**: Refine Context Panel interactions and integrate more artifact types.
- **LFCC v0.9.5**: Begin planning for v0.9.5 features.

## Active Planning: Phase 8 Rust-First Capabilities

We have analyzed the local roadmap changes and defined the following tracks for "Phase 8: Rust-First Agent Capabilities" (Q4 2027):

### Track AP: Workforce Orchestrator (Rust) [P0]
- **Scope**: Task graph, status machine, capability matching, failure handling.
- **Plan**: 3-week timeline covering data models, scheduling, and reliability.

### Track AQ: Tool and MCP Gateway (Rust) [P0]
- **Scope**: Tool registry, manifest validation, sandbox execution, policy/audit.
- **Plan**: 3-week timeline for registry, execution pipeline, and policy gates.

### Track AU: Local-First Data and Audit (Rust) [P0]
- **Scope**: Local storage for tasks/tools/models, encrypted audit logs, export.
- **Plan**: 2-week timeline for schema, persistence, and audit/export features.

### Track AS: Model Fabric and Routing (Rust) [P1]
- **Scope**: Provider registry, local model config, routing policy, telemetry.
- **Plan**: 2-week timeline for provider management and execution pipeline.

### Track AT: Agent Toolkit Library (Rust) [P1]
- **Scope**: Rust-native toolkits for files, docs, media analysis, and web deploy.
- **Plan**: 3-week timeline for file/note, document, and media toolkits.

### Track AR: Workspace Sessions and Human Loop (Rust) [P1]
- **Scope**: Live sessions (terminal/browser), streaming, approval workflows.
- **Plan**: 3-week timeline for session lifecycle, automation, and human-in-the-loop.
