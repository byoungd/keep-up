## Summary
- Phase 9 (Convergence) defined with parallel tracks and de-duplication guardrails.
- New track template and generator script added for consistent single-doc execution.
- Phase 9 track docs updated to include executable implementation specs and PR workflow.
- Deprecated workflow docs removed after completion confirmation.

## Changes

### Phase 9 Convergence
- New phase defined: `docs/roadmap/phase-9-convergence/README.md`.
- Tracks AV–AZ created with executable specs and single-doc execution checklists.

### Roadmap Tooling
- Track template added: `docs/roadmap/track-template.md`.
- Track generator added: `scripts/roadmap/create-track.ts`.
- New command: `pnpm roadmap:new-track`.

### Phase 6 Baselines
- Added perf baseline capture script: `scripts/lfcc-perf-baseline.mjs`.
- Added perf gate script: `scripts/perf-gate.mjs`.
- Captured initial cache benchmark baseline in `artifacts/perf-baseline.json`.
- Added Phase 6 metrics capture: `scripts/phase6-baseline.ts` (`pnpm perf:metrics`).
- Captured baseline metrics in `artifacts/perf-metrics.json` and updated `baseline-2026-01-24.md`.
- Extended Phase 6 metrics to include checkpoint save/load, diff patch timing, and spooler memory deltas.

### Sandbox Sidecar (AD)
- Added Rust sandbox execution mode for bash/code in Cowork runtime (`COWORK_SANDBOX_MODE=rust`).
- Rust sandbox now used for file policy enforcement via `createRustSandboxManager`.
- Added preflight support for Rust sandbox when `COWORK_SANDBOX_MODE=rust`.

### Tokenizer (AF)
- Added env override `TOKENIZER_RS_DISABLE_NATIVE=1` to force JS fallback.

### Cleanup
- Removed completed workflow docs:
  - `.agent/workflows/implement-lfcc-v0.9.5-markdown-rust.md`
  - `.agent/workflows/implement-security-sandbox.md`
  - `.agent/workflows/implement-subagents-architecture.md`

## Next Steps
- Use the track generator for new track creation.
- Begin Phase 9 execution by selecting one track and following its single-doc checklist.
